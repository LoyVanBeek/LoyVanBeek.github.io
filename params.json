{"name":"Loyvanbeek.github.io","tagline":"Loy's pages","body":"### Welcome to Loy's GitHub Pages.\r\nHi there, my name is Loy. On these pages, I (will) post about the stuff I do.\r\nSo, what do I do? Programming mostly. \r\nI work for [Sioux Embedded Systems](http://www.twitter.com/siouxsource) and in my free time I work on some hobby projects, such as making the Amigo robot do cool stuff. Scouting is another hobby, which I sometimes combine with programming. \r\n\r\nMost of my personal projects are on my GitHub page. \r\nSome examples: [a computer vision program that can play the Set card game](https://github.com/LoyVanBeek/SetVision), a [system](https://github.com/LoyVanBeek/Jotari_QRCode_Schedule) where kids in my scout group use a QR code to see what activities are planned for them and some ROS interfaces to Natural Language Processing (NLP) web APIs like [Maluuba](http://www.maluuba.com) and [Wit.ai](http://www.wit.ai) (ROS interfaces at https://github.com/LoyVanBeek/maluuba_ros and https://github.com/LoyVanBeek/wit_ros) \r\n\r\nThe languages I use most frequently are Python, C# and lately Prolog. I'd love to learn Lisp once I find a good application of it.  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
