Today, I was elected to be a member of the RoboCup@Home Technical Committee. Being a TC means writing the rulebook for RoboCup@Home, being a referee and making sure the robots & teams adhere to the rules of the competition.
We have quite some ideas for taking the rulebook to the next step:
- Requiring 3D navigation
- More intelligence required
- Test separate abilities first, then the integration of them

In the coming months, we (the TC is an international organisation, I'm the only Dutch guys with 2 people form Mexico and another from China) have to work to set up an improved rulebook that teams can work with.
